When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case I have changes on my local repository and pulling from remote
    maybe I lose my changes, right? Still need to be checked
    Change made from cloud
    And I added a line from computer then pushed
    After experiment, I came to the conclusion:
    Pulling changes automatically might create conflict
    Because I might be working on files that has been changed on remote
    pulling them will create conflict (as we saw on branches)
