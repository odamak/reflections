How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The bug could be easily detected when viewing a diff between 2 files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see how I evoluate as a programmer and as a thinker from version
    to version, I can even get inspired from early versions
    I actually realized that I use life version control
    which means that I write how I feel at least 2 or 3 or 4 times a month
    this enables me keep track of my feelings, emotions, thoughts
    and see how I can evoluate with that or bypass a current thing
    that I already faced during the past

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros is that you do the commit only when there is a logical change
    cons is that when you're perfectionist, the word "logical" change might
    lead you to commit only after big changes, which might end up after days
    of coding, this is why having versions automatically saved can be a solution sometimes 
    to sum up, making commit after logical changes + adding a deadline of 2 to 3 coding days for instance, might be a good option to consider

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it makes no sense having a constraint to save only one file per
    commit, knowing that a lots of time, when making changes, related
    files get changed, and keeping track of change that occured on related
    files is critical when tracking the evolution of an app

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log, applied at a git repository, gives all the history of changes
    that has been made
    git diff [id1] [id2] gives the difference between 2 changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that at any moment I can come back to previous version makes it
    more easy and gives more confidence to make even critical changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
